# Vault2Door â€” Dark Mode Fix (Compile-safe)

**Fixes**
- Added missing `graphPanel` field (caused CS0103).
- Replaced `chart.Background` (not in WinForms view) with `chart.BackColor`.
- Kept dark-mode axis paints & custom dark scrollbar.
- Fully resizable; min/max buttons.

Open `Vault2Door.sln`, restore NuGet packages, and Run.
